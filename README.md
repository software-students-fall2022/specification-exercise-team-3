- Needing to search for up to 20 minutes just to find a place to sit/study
- Having to move to a different location if all spots in a particular area are taken
- Found interviewees to have specific locations that are conducive to their productivity, and not finding any of them available is a major frustration as they would have to settle for an unideal location
- Not having/knowing about areas to study conversationally

Needs/Goals:
- Finding a spot to study
- Determining how packed an area for studying is
- Finding a “spot” to habitually go to 
- Effectively using all available time to study/work, (no wasting unnecessary time)
