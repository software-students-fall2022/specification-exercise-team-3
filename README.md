## Stakeholders

### Lin Shue (NYU Student)

Problems/Frustration:

- Needing to search for up to 20 minutes just to find a place to sit/study
- Having to move to a different location if all spots in a particular area are taken
- Has specific locations that are conducive to their productivity, and not finding any of them available is a major frustration as they would have to settle for an unideal location
- Not having/knowing about areas to study conversationally

Needs/Goals:
- Finding a spot to study
- Determining how packed an area for studying is
- Finding a new spot to habitually go to 
- Effectively using all available time to study/work (no wasting unnecessary time)

### Esther Wu (NYU IT Desk Member):
Problems/Frustrations:
- Some complaints about premature shutdown of NYU Scan & Reserve
- Not nearly enough usage as what was expected, and hardly know anyone that used it personally
- App maintenance could have been better; certain bugs like automatics sign-outs made the app difficult to use
- Lack of use among student body meant that students sometimes encountered someone already sitting at their reserved space; a reservation system may not be the ideal solution for students looking to find study spots with available seating

Needs/Goals:
- Reinstate ability view available seating in library and other locations, save for the Eat reservations (COVID-19 area capacity restrictions have been lifted)
- Offer a students a way to easily contact other students through the app for a joint study session—essentially a social component
- The option to filter locations by more than just space type and hours, such as noise level
- Make the app feel easy to navigate and communicate its purpose clearly so that more students would feel inclined to use it
- Plans were set to introduce a fun tab (displayed as “coming soon” in the app) to introduce students to different events around campus
